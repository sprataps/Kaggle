Discovery of the long awaited Higgs boson was announced July 4, 2012 and confirmed six months later.
2013 saw a number of prestigious awards, including a Nobel prize. But for physicists, the discovery 
of a new particle means the beginning of a long and difficult quest to measure its characteristics 
and determine if it fits the current model of nature.

A key property of any particle is how often it decays into other particles. ATLAS is a particle
physics experiment taking place at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN that searches for new particles
and processes using head-on collisions of protons of extraordinarily high energy. The ATLAS experiment
has recently observed a signal of the Higgs boson decaying into two tau particles, but this decay is a
small signal buried in background noise. 

The goal of the Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge is to explore the potential of advanced machine
learning methods to improve the discovery significance of the experiment. No knowledge of particle 
physics is required. Using simulated data with features characterizing events detected by ATLAS, your
task is to classify events into "tau tau decay of a Higgs boson" versus "background."
